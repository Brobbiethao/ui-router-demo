# Routing with UI-Router

## Objectives
Here's what I would like for you to be able to do by the end of today: 

1. Make fun of Shea
2. Setup routes in your app.js
3. Navigate to routes through your app
4. Break out the controllers and views of your routes
5. Pass data to a route
6. Retrieve the data passed
7. Make fun of Shea

If we have time, here are some other things to think about:

-- SPA vs. Traditional App
When should we use a SPA? What are the advantanges? Disadvantages?

-- Child Routes
How can we nest routes? (See example 4.)
Why would we want to do this? 
What are the disadvantages? 

-- Resolve
What data might you want before a state loads? 
How can you use a resolve to get it? 
How might this help with authentication?
